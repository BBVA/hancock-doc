# Hancock guidebook 

Hancock is a research product conceived within BBVA New digital business - R&D that provides convenient services to integrate with different DLT networks. We provide simplicity, adaptability and efficiently to develop in any DLT. Hancock is a journey to industrial and productive Blockchain applications. 

Hancock can be divided into three main components:

- DLT Adapter - Keep it simple Interface to abstract interaction with different DLT networks.

- Wallet Hub - Enroute Interactions Enable connect their signer wallets, or wallet service providers, to the wallet hub, that will then route any ready-to-sign transaction.

- DLT Broker - Real time notifications Provides a websocket connection that propagates any DLT event the user is subscribed. Thus, provides an interface to easily and efficiently subscribe to blockchain asynchronous events to avoid constant request of status.

We also offer a sdk that provides a simplified consumption of all Hancock services. It reducing the time-to-market also ensures best practices, minimizing the risk for errors and improving products quality.

# Motivation

Every blockchain has its own interfaces, even though they share a common functionality. 

Most applications have poor management of digital signatures, private keys and wallet management. Poor management of blockchain asynchronous nature, with delay in confirmations.

Hancock is like a bridge for blockchains, offer a sdk and an API to manage connections to blockchain, and you can focus on develop your bussiness application.

# Current blockchains supported

 - Ethereum

# Next steps

We are working on integrate other blockchains networks to Hancock language. 

Next blockchain networks:
 - Bitcoin
