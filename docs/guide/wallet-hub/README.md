# Hancock Wallet hub

This microservice belonging to Hancock's ecosystem, allows you to send transactions to DLT and to sign the transactions with the help of a sign provider service previously configured.

To be able to sign transactions in blockchain we need a private key. To avoid centralizing the user's private key we need to support different signature providers. In order to have different signature providers, we need to add a service to the system that will allow suppliers to be registered, making it possible for the system to be able to consume them, thus allowing a user to choose their signature provider.able to consume them, thus allowing a user to choose their signature provider.
